# 2021-01-21 - complex features - task value

In these runs, we repeat our 2021-01-20 experiments, except we make the rewards and punishments for the fluctuating tasks more extreme (two-fold to four-fold effect).

Depending on the results of the 2021-01-20 experiment, I may cut the 1.03x extra task value condition.
