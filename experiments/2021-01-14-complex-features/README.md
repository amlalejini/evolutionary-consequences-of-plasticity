# 2021-01-14 - Evolution of complex features experiment

In these runs, we compare the capacity for plastic and non-plastic populations to evolve and retain complex features in fluctuating environments.

Conditions

- Non-plastic (no-sensors), fluctuating environment
- Plastic (sensors), fluctuating environment
- Non-plastic (no-sensors), constant environment

Extra task values

- x1 (no selection)
- x1.03
- x1.10
- x1.30

Extra controls

- Genome length (constant length)
  - DIVIDE_INS_PROB 0.0
  - DIVIDE_DEL_PROB 0.0
  - OFFSPRING_SIZE_RANGE 1.0
  - STERILIZE_UNSTABLE 1
