# 2021-02-01 - Deleterious hitchhiking experiment - Half tasks control

In these runs, we investigate the propensity for deleterious hitchhiking in plastic and non-plastic populations.

The goal of this experiment is to check that our deleterious hitchhiking results are not due to organisms in plastic and non-plastic (constant) needing extra genetic machinery in their genomes than non-plastic (fluctuating) populations.

Conditions

- Environment/plasticity
  - Non-plastic (no-sensors), fluctuating environment
  - Plastic (sensors), fluctuating environment
  - Non-plastic (no-sensors), constant ENV-A
  - Non-plastic (no-sensors), constant ENV-B
- Deleterious instruction
  - Instruction: `poison`
  - Poison penalties: 0.03 (low), 0.1 (moderate), 0.3 (high)
