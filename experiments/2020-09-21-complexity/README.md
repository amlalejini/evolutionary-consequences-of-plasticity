# 2020-09-21 - Evolutionary consequences of phenotypic plasticity - Novel metabolic pathways

Plasticity stabilizes the population's location in the fitness landscape. Does this stability affect the evolution of novel metabolic pathways?

Are plastic populations able to support low-payoff and more complex additional metabolic activity?

Two-phase experiment

- Phase 1
  - Fluctuate environment between envA and envB
    - envA: 3 of the first 6 logic-9 tasks
    - envB: 3 of the first 6 logic-9 tasks
- Phase 2
  - Fluctuate environment between envA and envB
    - (environments A and B are same as in phase 1)
  - Add extra (more complex) tasks (i.e., more rewarded metabolic pathways)
    - Two possible setups:
      - (1) the remaining 3 logic-9 tasks (NOR, XOR, EQU)
        - extra tasks increase merit by 1.1 multiplier
      - (2) all 3 input tasks (+ 3 extra logic-9 tasks)
        - extra tasks increase merit by 1.01 multiplier
