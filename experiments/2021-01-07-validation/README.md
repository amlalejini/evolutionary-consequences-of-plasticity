# 2021-01-07 - Validation Experiments

Validate the capacity for phenotypic plasticity to evolve in a fluctuating environment when environmental states can be differentiated by sensory instructions.

Expectations

- Plasticity evolves in conditions with fluctuating environment and sensory instructions.
- Plasticity does not evolve in condition with a constant environment or without sensory instructions.
