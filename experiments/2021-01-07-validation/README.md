# 2021-01-07 - Validation Experiments

Validate the capacity for phenotypic plasticity to evolve in a fluctuating environment when environmental states can be differentiated by sensory instructions.

Expectations

- Plasticity evolves in conditions with fluctuating environment and sensory instructions.
- Plasticity does not evolve in condition with a constant environment or without sensory instructions.

Conditions

- Constant environment
  - sensors, no sensors
- Changing environment
  - sensors, no sensors

We only expect adaptive plasticity to evolve in the changing environment with sensors. In all other conditions, we do not expect to observe the evolution of adaptive plasticity.
