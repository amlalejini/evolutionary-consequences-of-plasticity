# 2021-01-31 - Deleterious hitchhiking experiment

In these runs, we investigate the propensity for deleterious hitchhiking in plastic and non-plastic populations.

Conditions

- Environment/plasticity
  - Non-plastic (no-sensors), fluctuating environment
  - Plastic (sensors), fluctuating environment
  - Non-plastic (no-sensors), constant environment
- Deleterious instruction
  - Instruction: `poison`
  - Poison penalties: 0.03 (low), 0.1 (moderate), 0.3 (high)
