# 2021-01-32 Complex features experiment

Based on 2021-01-14/2021-01-20 complex features experiments.

In these runs, we compare the capacity for plastic and non-plastic populations to evolve and retain complex features in fluctuating environments.

Conditions

- Non-plastic (no-sensors), fluctuating environment
- Plastic (sensors), fluctuating environment
- Non-plastic (no-sensors), constant environment

Extra task values

- x1 (no selection)
- x1.10

Important details

- Fixed length genomes
  - Parameters:
    - DIVIDE_INS_PROB 0.0
    - DIVIDE_DEL_PROB 0.0
    - OFFSPRING_SIZE_RANGE 1.0
